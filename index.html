                Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a fullstack developer and musician.
            </section>

            <section>
                <p class="bio">I am a fullstack web developer and recent graduate of the Flex Fullstack bootcamp at
                    Thinkful. I love
                    coding
                    as I love
                    to exercise my brain, and love the process of establishing a problem to solve and solving it. I love
                    conceptualizing and
                    building applications as well as learning new technologies designed to facilitate the former.

                    When I am not coding, you can find me composing music or at an open mic night with my acoustic
                    guitar. I
                    also
                    have an
                    affinity for Asia and you may find me in the closest remaining thing to the wild west (which I also
                    love),
                    Southeast
                    Asia when I take a vacation.

                    What else is there to know? I am a cinephile, gangster movie connoisseur, taco junkie, concert-goer
                    (mainly progressive music/metal). I also like jazz and rock, and I am just learning to appreciate
                    country. I also love video games, but unfortunately have had to reduce my play-time to completing
                    one video game a year. I only play video games with an ending as I simply do not have time for a
                    game that never ends (how does anyone come to think of it?).

                    If you want to know more. Just ask. Looking forward to hearing from you.
